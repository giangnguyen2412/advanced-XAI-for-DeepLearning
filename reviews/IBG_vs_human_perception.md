# Passive attention in artificial neural networks predicts human visual selectivity

## One-sentence summary

 - It bridged cognitive sciences vs. deep learning. A lot of human behavioral tasks were adopted to validate AI's perception.

 - This paper created human attention maps which can be used as the ground truth for feature attribution method research.

 - Very thoughtful and super extensive experiments (most ever seen for me).

 I think that we may rebuild the **feature attribution research** community based on this work.

 I made a slide for this paper [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11hMqV6WgxjnwhnzTdk_FDI_hcOu9he7T/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=106754253201604804412&rtpof=true&sd=true).
