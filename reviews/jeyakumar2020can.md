# How Can I Explain This to You? An Empirical Study of Deep Neural Network Explanation Methods

## One-sentence summary

This paper surveys the preference of lay-users to explanation methods across 4 domains: image, text, audio, and ECG data and found that example-based explanations are preferred by humans in many domains (CIFAR-10, text, ECG signal classification) except for text sentiment analysis where LIME is the most preferred.

## Ideas and method

The experiment design is simpler than [1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.14944) but straightforward and easy to reproduce. When these two works are very close, it would be nice to study the correlation between the correlation vs. effectiveness of an explanation method.
