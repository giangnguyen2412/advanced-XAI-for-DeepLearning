# How Useful Are the Machine-Generated Interpretations to General Users? A Human Evaluation on Guessing the Incorrectly Predicted Labels

## Summary

This paper presents an investigation on whether or not
showing machine-generated visual interpretations helps users
understand the incorrectly predicted labels produced by image classifiers. We showed the images and the correct labels
to 150 online crowd workers and asked them to select the incorrectly predicted labels with or without showing them the
machine-generated visual interpretations. The results demonstrated that displaying the visual interpretations did not increase, but rather decreased, the average guessing accuracy
by roughly 10%.
